<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m a married individual with two wonderful kids. My journey began at Ateneo de Davao University, where I earned my bachelor’s degree in Information Management back in 2009. After graduation, I worked as a project support professional at HRC Lifemates for a year.</p>

<p>However, my path soon led me to the exciting world of banking. For a remarkable 12 years, I contributed my skills and expertise to the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI). During my tenure, I held the position of Senior Service Associate, where I assisted countless customers and played a vital role in ensuring smooth banking operations.</p>

<p>Now, I’ve set my sights on a new adventure: the tech industry! As a web developer, I’m passionate about creating innovative solutions, crafting beautiful websites, and contributing to the digital landscape. </p>

<p>Feel free to connect—I’d love to chat about my experiences!</p>
